## COUPEX – Smart Coupon & Discount Management System
COUPEX is a smart web-based application that helps users store, organize, and manage discount coupons efficiently.  
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it eliminates the problem of losing or forgetting coupons by providing an intuitive, browser-based platform for tracking and managing deals.

## About the Project
Many people collect coupons and discount codes from online stores, emails, or shopping platforms — but most of them expire unused because they are hard to track.  
COUPEX solves this issue by allowing users to:

- Add and categorize coupons easily  
- Track expiry dates  
- Mark coupons as used or active  
- Filter and search through stored coupons  
- Get notifications when a coupon is about to expire  

## Features
- Add, Edit, and Delete Coupons  
- Search and Filter by Category or Status  
- Expiry Date and Reminder Notifications  
- Statistics (Active, Used, Expired Coupons)  
- LocalStorage-based Data Persistence  
- Login & Registration with Local Authentication
